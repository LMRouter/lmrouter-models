  description: Qwen3-235B-A22B is a 235B parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model developed by Qwen, activating 22B parameters per forward pass. It supports seamless switching between a "thinking" mode for complex reasoning, math, and code tasks, and a "non-thinking" mode for general conversational efficiency. The model demonstrates strong reasoning ability, multilingual support (100+ languages and dialects), advanced instruction-following, and agent tool-calling capabilities. It natively handles a 32K token context window and extends up to 131K tokens using YaRN-based scaling.
