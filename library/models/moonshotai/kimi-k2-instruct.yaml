It is optimized for agentic capabilities, including advanced tool use, reasoning, and code synthesis. Kimi K2 excels across a broad range of benchmarks, particularly in coding (LiveCodeBench, SWE-bench), reasoning (ZebraLogic, GPQA), and tool-use (Tau2, AceBench) tasks. It supports long-context inference up to 128K tokens and is designed with a novel training stack that includes the MuonClip optimizer for stable large-scale MoE training.
